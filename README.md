Research Paper-> Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Network

-----HOW TO USE----

1.Clone the repository and install the required dependencies

2.Run style_transfer.py file with arguements as

a)--content_path => path to content image (takes an image from image folder by default)

b)--style_path => path to style image (takes an image from image folder by default)
